## About Me

I'm Maykool Jimenez. I live in Costa Rica, with my wife, two dogs and three children. Working as an outsorce software developer since 2007 most of it as outsorcing with experience in different industries (bank, finance, insurance, health care), mostly related to Microsoft technologies with .Net (C #, Visual Basic, ASP.NET ASP.NET Core, WCF), web technologies (Jquery, AJAX, JavaScript, Angular, MVC client, MVVM) and some experience with JAVA 8, mobile applications and including migrations from VB6 to .NET. I also have experience working in the processes of quality control and assurance.

10 years of experience in agile methodologies such as scrum and safe.

I consider myself a team player; ready to share what I know and learn from others. I enjoy the technical challenges and I am always ready to put my 110% to complete those challenges.
