I also have experience on migrations from VB6 to .NET. and quality control and assurance processes.

I have been working with with agile methodologies such as scrum and safe since 2010 and I love them ♡.

I consider myself a team player; ready to share what I know and learn from others. I enjoy the technical challenges and I am always ready to put my 110% to complete those challenges.
